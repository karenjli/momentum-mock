# Momentum Replica

This project aims to replicate the functionality of the popular desktop extension called "Momentum." It provides a customizable dashboard that includes a clock, an input field for entering goals, a scenic background image, and a motivational quote. Additional features such as fetching weather data from an API and an embedded to-do list will be added in future updates.

## Features

- **Clock**: The dashboard displays a live clock, providing the current time to the user.

- **Goal Input**: Users can enter their goals or tasks in an input field, which allows them to stay organized and focused.

- **Scenery Image**: The background of the dashboard is set to a beautiful and serene scenery image, creating a visually pleasing experience.

- **Motivational Quote**: A motivational quote is displayed on the dashboard to inspire and uplift users.

## Future Updates

We have exciting plans to enhance the Momentum Replica with the following features:

- **Weather API**: Fetching weather data from an API will enable the dashboard to display current weather conditions, helping users plan their day accordingly.

- **Embedded To-Do List**: An embedded to-do list will be added, allowing users to manage their tasks and prioritize their activities within the dashboard itself.
